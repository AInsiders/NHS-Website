        <h2>What is Mediation?</h2>
        <p>Mediation is a collaborative process where a neutral third party helps people in conflict reach a mutually acceptable resolution. Unlike court battles, mediation is private, less expensive, and gives you control over the outcome. As a Listed Rule 31 Mediator with family-law special designation, we provide expert guidance to resolve disputes efficiently and amicably.</p>

          <h3>Why Choose Mediation?</h3>
          <p>Mediation offers significant advantages over traditional litigation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Mediation typically costs much less than going to court</li>
            <li><strong>Faster Resolution:</strong> Disputes can often be resolved in days or weeks, not months or years</li>
            <li><strong>Private & Confidential:</strong> What happens in mediation stays private, unlike public court proceedings</li>
            <li><strong>Control Over Outcome:</strong> You decide the terms of your agreement, not a judge</li>
            <li><strong>Preserves Relationships:</strong> Mediation focuses on finding solutions, not assigning blame</li>
            <li><strong>Less Stressful:</strong> A collaborative approach reduces the emotional toll of conflict</li>
