        <h2>What is Estate Planning?</h2>
        <p>Estate planning is like creating a roadmap for your family's future. It's not just about what happens after you're gone—it's about protecting your loved ones and ensuring your wishes are carried out exactly as you want them to be.</p>

          <h3>Why Estate Planning Matters</h3>
          <p>Think of estate planning as a safety net for your family. Without proper planning, your loved ones could face:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Probate Court:</strong> A lengthy, expensive, and public process that can take months or even years</li>
            <li><strong>Family Disputes:</strong> Confusion and potential conflicts about who gets what</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Burdens:</strong> Unnecessary taxes that could have been avoided with proper planning</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> Courts making decisions about your assets instead of you</li>
          </ul>
